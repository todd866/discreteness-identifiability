# Discreteness from Identifiability

**Why continuous physics produces integers: observation defines a quotient, and quotients produce discrete equivalence classes.**

## Overview

Discrete phenomena pervade physics: quantum numbers, particle species, phase transitions, symbolic codes. Yet the underlying state spaces are continuous. We identify a unifying mechanism: when a high-dimensional continuous system is observed through a constraint, symmetry, or projection, the observation map induces equivalence classes. The number of distinguishable classes — the rank of the differential — is necessarily integer-valued.

**Core claim:** Discreteness is not fundamental; identifiability is.

## Key Results

- **Quotient mechanism**: Observation defines equivalence classes; equivalence classes are necessarily discrete
- **Rank as integer invariant**: The identifiable dimension `rank(dh)` can only take integer values, producing discrete jumps under structural changes
- **Cross-domain unification**: Same mechanism in information geometry (Fisher rank), quantum mechanics (eigenvalues), symbol formation (tokens), cosmology (particle species)
- **Anthropic dissolution**: "Why something rather than nothing" dissolves — to observe is to project, to project is to produce discreteness
