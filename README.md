## Overview

Discrete phenomena pervade physics: quantum numbers, particle species, phase transitions, symbolic codes. Yet the underlying state spaces are continuous. We identify a unifying mechanism: observation maps carry integer-valued invariants (rank, dimension, index) that can change only discretely.

The key invariant is the **identifiable dimension** (rank of the observation differential), which controls how many effective degrees of freedom are accessible. When this rank changes, qualitative transitions occur.

**Core claim:** Discreteness is not fundamental; identifiability is.

## What This Paper Claims (and Does NOT Claim)

**What we claim:**
- Observation maps carry integer-valued invariants (rank, dimension, index)
- Discrete transitions in observed phenomena correspond to discrete changes in these invariants
- This mechanism operates across domains: information geometry, quantum mechanics, symbol formation

**What we do NOT claim:**
- Quotients automatically produce discrete equivalence classes (they don't - see Section 2.3)
- Continuous spectra don't exist (they do - see Section 4.2)
- All fine-tuning reduces to one principle (it might, but this is conjecture - see Section 6)

## Key Results

- **Integer invariants**: Observation maps carry rank, dimension, index - all integers
- **Bridge proposition**: Identifiable dimension controls effective coordinates; changes produce qualitative transitions
- **Worked example**: Gaussian sum shows rank jump under coupling activation
- **Cross-domain unification**: Same structure in Fisher rank, quantum degeneracies, symbol alphabets

## Limitations

The paper explicitly flags speculative content. The connection between local differential geometry (rank of maps) and cosmological/anthropic structure is conjectural, not proven.
