# Discreteness from Identifiability

**Why continuous physics produces integers: observation defines a quotient, and quotients produce discrete equivalence classes.**

## Overview

Discrete phenomena pervade physics: quantum numbers, particle species, phase transitions, symbolic codes. Yet the underlying state spaces are continuous. We identify a unifying mechanism: when a high-dimensional continuous system is observed through a constraint, symmetry, or projection, the observation map induces equivalence classes. The number of distinguishable classes — the rank of the differential — is necessarily integer-valued.

**Core claim:** Discreteness is not fundamental; identifiability is.

## The Anthropic Reduction

The standard anthropic principle fragments into dozens of fine-tuning puzzles. This paper reduces all of them to a single geometric requirement:

> **Dimensionality must be variable.**

The argument:
1. Observation requires projection (high-D → low-D)
2. Projection requires a dimensional gradient
3. If dimensionality were uniform everywhere, there would be no projection, no observation, no observers
4. Therefore: observers necessarily find themselves where dimensionality varies

All fine-tuning (constants, chemistry, cosmology) reduces to: *does this configuration permit dimensional gradients that support observation?*

## Key Results

- **Quotient mechanism**: Observation defines equivalence classes; equivalence classes are necessarily discrete
- **Anthropic reduction**: One condition (variable dimensionality) replaces dozens of fine-tuning puzzles
- **Cross-domain unification**: Same mechanism in information geometry (Fisher rank), quantum mechanics (eigenvalues), symbol formation (tokens), cosmology (particle species)
- **"Why something?" dissolved**: To ask is to observe; to observe is to project; projection produces integers
